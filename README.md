# Develop an application to manage notes. Note has a title and content.<br>

Requirements:<br>
User can have a possibility to:<br>
Create note<br>
Delete note<br>
Edit note (both title and content)<br>
Notification snackbar (e.g. https://material-ui.com/demos/snackbars/)<br>
After creating or deleting the note user should see a notification snackbar for 2s.<br>
Notification has “Undo” button, clicking on which user can revert the action while notification is visible.<br>
Notification should be animated (optional).<br>
API integration. <br>
We provide an API to manage notes. It is simple CRUD API. However, we intentionally configured a 30% failure rate. It means that every 3rd request to server will fail and you should be ready to handle it.<br>
When user open the app, load all notes from the API.<br>
All changes to notes (creation, editing and deletion) should be reflected on the backend via API.<br>

API URL  http://159.89.96.181/api/v1/<br>
Design and other details is up to you, just be ready to argument them.<br>
Use Git, your solution should have commit history and send a link to your repository.<br>
Solution should be executable with one or two commands. Provide an instruction.<br>
